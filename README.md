# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Java implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms, including stacks, queues, array lists, sorting algorithms, and hashing. Each concept is implemented in a separate file with example usage in the `main` method.

## Contents

- [ArrayLists.java](ArrayLists.java): Demonstrates usage of Java's `ArrayList` including adding, removing, setting, and sorting elements.
- [BinarySearch.java](BinarySearch.java): Placeholder for binary search implementation.
- [Hashing.java](Hashing.java): Shows how to use Java's `HashMap` for basic hashing operations like insertion, search, and iteration.
- [QueueY.java](QueueY.java): Implements a circular queue using an array with enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
- [Sorting.java](Sorting.java): Contains implementations of selection sort and merge sort, with commented-out code for bubble sort and insertion sort.
- [StackClass.java](StackClass.java): Implements a stack using a singly linked list with push, pop, and peek operations.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed (`javac` and `java` commands available).
2. Compile the desired file, for example:
   ```sh
   javac StackClass.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled class:
   ```sh
   java StackClass
   ```

Repeat the above steps for any file you wish to test.

## Notes

- Each file contains a `main` method with sample usage.
- Some files (like `BinarySearch.java`) may be incomplete or placeholders for future implementations.
- The code is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates basic data structure and algorithm concepts in Java.
